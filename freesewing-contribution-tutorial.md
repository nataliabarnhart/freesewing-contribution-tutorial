# Git(Hub) Good: Let’s walk through a simple FreeSewing contribution together

You — yes, you — can contribute to FreeSewing. On the way, you can learn a little bit about GitHub. Don’t panic. You’ll love it.

I think the easiest way to get your feet wet is cruising around the documentation at [FreeSewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) or [FreeSewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev). Occasionally you’ll find a typo or a broken link, or just an opportunity to phrase something more clearly.

On [FreeSewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev), you can click on [For Editors](https://freesewing.dev/editors/) for a friendly reference guide. At time of writing, I did that and tried clicking the [Common tasks for editors](https://freesewing.dev/howtos/editors/) link at the bottom. It took me to a *Page not found* message with a sad robot. Yippee!! Let’s fix it.

First, let’s find the correct link. I know I’m looking for a page called *Common tasks for editors*, so I click the magnifying glass icon, put “Common tasks for editors” in the search bar and get this: https://freesewing.dev/editors/howtos. Looks good.

Then, let’s go back to the *For editors* page. Click the pencil icon next to the page title.

Hey, now we’re in GitHub. Let’s create an account.

After creating our account, we'll fork the FreeSewing markdown repository, or repo. The repo contains a bunch of FreeSewing’s files and the history of changes to those files.

At this point, we're editing the *For editors* file. We’ll swap out the old link with the new link we identified, and then propose changes. Let’s give the proposal a nice title and description.

Time to submit a pull request! Now we’re cooking with fire. A pull request, or PR, is a way to tell FreeSewing that we are proposing a change. In this case we’re saying, hi, I found a broken link and I fixed it.

Finally, someone at FreeSewing will review the PR and say cool, this looks great, so I’ll accept the change; I’ll *merge* it. That will send you, the author, a brief email, it’ll be updated in GitHub, and when Joost next deploys the site, typically within a week or so, you’ll see your contributions live on FreeSewing.org or FreeSewing.dev. Crushed it.
